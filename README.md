bash compose.sh 10.0.10.1 admin adminpwd 10923 1
````

Parameters:

- DURATION:

    - ``8``: "Six_Months",
    - ``9``: "One_Year"

## Output results

Within the output directory all metric results for: 
- Energy consumption 
- Temperature

They are stored as: ``power_metrics.csv`` and ``temperature_metrics.csv`` respectively.

### Power consumption Metrics

It has 4 fields: ``date``, ``maximum``, ``average`` and  ``minimum`` power consumption in Watts/houe (W/h).
